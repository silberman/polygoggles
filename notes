TODOS:

insert a random image from collection_dir/train, just for notebook knowledge
better comment at top of research notebook
add Dockerfile and Makefile
in deep_polygoggles, figure out where the 1036800 comes from, automate that so whole deep_poly is automatable
make irregular polygons or move to some other data set, like OSM
look into differnt types of output, rather than one-hot
continue udacity class

To display a local file as an image in a jupyter notebook:

that works if it's a bull /Users/dansilberman, etc etc
